Add good looking and well-written open-source LaTeX template,
with commands to compile them with LaTeX-on-HTTP.

Eventually it will allow us to create a website with a template section
to get started with LaTeX-on-HTTP. Each template section will include:
* the template PDF preview
* the raw source
* the template source with templating (interpolation yaml) with various sytems (Pandoc, Jinja2, moustache)
* sample codes to compile the template in several languages (Python, Node, Javascript/browser, Java, PHP, Ruby, ...),
several libraries (requests, fetch, jQuery, ...), several CLI (Curl, HTTPie, ...)

Add these good templates:
